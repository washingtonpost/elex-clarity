Overview
------------

This library

* Provides a simple CLI tool for pulling in and formatting election results from a Clarity-backed website or local file
* Separates data retrieval from data formatting
* By default, returns results formatted like so

    .. code-block:: python

        {
            "2020-11-03_GA_G_P": {
                "id": "2020-11-03_GA_G_P",
                "source": "clarity",

                    "joseph_r_biden_dem": 2474507,
                    "jo_jorgensen_lib": 62138
                },

                    "appling": {
                        "id": "appling",
                        "counts": {
                            "donald_j_trump_i_rep": 6526,

                        }
                    },
                    ...
                }
            }
        }


Installation
------------

* Make sure you have python 3.7+ installed
* Optional: we recommend that you set up a `virtualenv <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and activate it
* ``pip install elex-clarity``


Usage
---------

All CLI commands require a Clarity election ID and state postal code. For example

``elexclarity 105369 GA``

The election ID can be found by navigating to the election in question in whichever results site you're viewing. For example, for Georgia, the Secretary of State's website links to `election results <https://sos.ga.gov/page/georgia-election-results>`_. Following the `Current Election Results` link you get to a clarity page with many election results pages. Looking at the 2020-current results will lead to ``https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/105369/web.264614/#/summary``, which contains the election ID right after the state postal code.

Formatting data from a local file:

* ``elexclarity 105369 GA --level=precinct --filename="tests/fixtures/results/ga_atkinson_precincts_11-3.xml" --countyMapping='<mapping json>'``
* ``elexclarity 105369 GA --level=county --filename="tests/fixtures/ga_counties_11-3.xml" --countyMapping='<mapping json>'``

Development
------------

* Clone this repository
* ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* ``tox``
* You should see some code coverage info and test results
* If the above was successful, you are ready for development

Releasing a New Version
------------------------

In preparation for a new release:

* Decide what the next version will be per semantic versioning
* Make a new branch named ``release/<version number>``
* Update the changelog with all changes that will be included in the release
* Commit your changes and make a PR against ``main``
* Once the changes are merged, tag ``main`` (or ``develop`` for a beta release) with the release's version number and push that tag (``git push --tags``)
* Merge ``main`` into ``develop``
